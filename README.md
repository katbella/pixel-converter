## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/katbella/pixel-converter.git
cd pixel-converter
npm install
```
### 2. Start in dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Build the app

This will create the releases folder with the app for macOS and Windows.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Motivation
I created this app because I needed a simple and fast image format converter for my own use (mostly for .HEICs). I couldn't find one that met my needs that wasn't online or littered with ads and tracking, so I decided to build it myself.

If you find it useful, [consider buying me a coffee ☕️](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pixelator).

## Roadmap
- i18n and l10n
