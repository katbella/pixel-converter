## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pixel-converter.git
cd pixel-converter
npm install

## 🔥 Motivation
I created this app because I needed a simple and fast image format converter for my own use (mostly for .HEICs). I couldn't find one that met my needs that wasn't online or littered with ads and tracking, so I decided to build it myself.
